Q1. Two bullets were are loaded into a gun's round consecutively. The barrel has a capacity of 6. The gun is fired once, but not bullet is shot. Does rolling the barrel (shuffling) before next shot increase the probability of firing a bullet ?
ans:
<-- Initial Misstep -->:If the two bullets are randomly put instead of consecutively, then, after firing one empty shot, there are 2 bullets and 5 total slots. The probability would be 2/5 = 40%, but that's not the case here.

<-- Correct step --> : The probability of firing a bullet without a shuffle is 1/4=25%. To understand this, imagine that the firing pin was on one of the empty slots (3,4,5,6), and the first shot was taken, but no bullet was fired. Now assumming that the barrel rotates clockwise, the pin will move to one of these slots: (2,3,4,5). Out of these four slots, only the slot (1) (1) has a bullet. Hence probability of firing a bullet is 1/4=25%. Note that the same is true in anti-clockwise direction.

After the shuffle, the state is reset. There are 6 total slots with 2 bullets, the probabilty of firing a bullet after a shuffle is 2/6=1/3â‰ˆ33%.

Thus, shuffling does increase the probability of firing a bullet (from 25% to 33%).
